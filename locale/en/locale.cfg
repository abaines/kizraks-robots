[entity-description]
# Taken from base.cfg
k-logistic-chest-active-provider=Sends its content to the logistic network.\n\nLess storage than normal.
k-logistic-chest-passive-provider=Makes its content available for the logistic network.\n\nLess storage than normal.
k-logistic-chest-storage=Long-term storage for the logistic network.\n\nLess storage than normal and no logistic filter.
k-logistic-chest-buffer=Requests specified items to be available for personal logistics and automated construction.\n\nLess storage and fewer logistic request slots than normal.
k-logistic-chest-requester=Requests specified items from the logistic network.\n\nLess storage and fewer logistic request slots than normal.

k-roboport=Connects with other roboports to create the construction and logistic networks used by construction and logistic robots.\n\nPhysically large but with smaller logistic and construction network radii and less storage than a normal roboport. Also consumes more energy and charges slower.

k-logistic-robot=Transports items between logistic chests.\n\nSlower than normal.
k-construction-robot=Automatically build and repair friendly entities.\n\nSlower than normal.
